## This script is to establish the upper and lower bounds for the manager and user budgets. Here I will use simulations to establish where the thresholds are below which the user/manager loses all power (i.e. user/manger budget is too low relative to the other actor's budget budget)

### thresh1 - user budget static, manager budget varying ####

## Here I will fix the user budget at 1000, and then vary the manager budget from very low (50) to very high (4000) over a long time period to see if we can see the thresholds.

# Ok, so when the manager budget is varied (thresh1 and thresh3), we see that around time step 25 the user loses most of their ability to cull trees. This is less certain in thresh3, as the drop off in cull count is slower than in thresh1. There is some very minor culling right to the end of the simulation in thresh3, but it is very minor towards the end. For thresh1 the point at which the majority of culling stops (cull count into singel figures), is when the manager budget is 1300. So when the manager budget is about 130% of the user budget (or the user budget is ~ 75-77% of the manager budget). The cull count in thresh3 never drops into single figures, but the point at which it drops below 100 is time step 63 when the manager budget is 6300, or 126% of the user budget (or the user budget is 80% of the manager budget). The interesting thing to note is that the total number of trees lost is dramatically larger in thresh3. This will be because of the relative differences in manager and user budget - in thresh1 the manager budget starts off at 5% of the user budget, whereas in thresh3 the manager budget starts off at 2%, and so the manager has less power.   

# When the user budget is varied there is little culling at all until around time step 14 (thresh2) and time step 19 (thresh4), when the user budget is 700 (so 70% of the manager budget), and 1900 (38% of the manager budget). I am not sure exactly where the manager loses all power, but I am assuming it is the point at which they stop varying the cost of culling (i.e. they have fixed the cost of culling at the maximum). For thresh2 this is time step 25, where the user budget is 1250. This is where the manager budget is 80% of the user budget. For thresh4 this actually never quite happens, but most of the cost variation stops around time step 50, when the user and manager budgets are equal. 

# Brad mentioned that he viewed the point of the manager losing all power as the resource extinction, but seeing as in this landscape set up (millions of trees, few users), this is never going to happen. Myself and Nils think that in terms of mapping to reality, the point at which the manager effectively loses all power is when they are maxing out their budget on setting as high a cost as possible, but it is not really having any effect and they stop trying to adaptively manage.  


### Changing frequency - IGNORE ####


## below is code that was experimenting with sine waves and changing the frequency as you go along the time period (with help from Brad). This was one approach to scenario 5, but we ended up going down a different route (See "Fourier Transform" section). At the bottom of this section was a crude attempt by me to randomly select the point at which the peaks appeared.


q <- seq(0,50,length.out=50)
r <- 500*sin(1*q+0)+1000
plot(q,r,type="l", ylim = c(0,1600))

# These are ways of just generating random numbers drawn from either Poisson or normal distributions, or random sampling
budget <- rpois(n = 1, lambda = r)
budget  <- floor( rnorm(n = 1, mean = r, sd = 500) )
budget <- sample(x = 1000:20000, size = 1)


# this creates random noise around the sin wave
xx <- seq(from = 0, to = 2*3.14, by = 0.1)
yy <- sin(xx)
plot(xx, yy + runif(n = length(xx), min = -0.1, max = 0.1), type = "l")
plot(xx, yy + runif(n = length(xx), min = -0.4, max = 0.4), type = "l")
plot(xx, 10000 + floor(1000 * (yy + runif(n = length(xx), min = -0.4, max = 0.4))), type = "l")


# this changes the wavelength over time
# changing the number that xx is multiplied by in the definition of yy changes the number of peaks. Changing the power fraction of xx changes the amount the frequency changes by. Smaller fractions change the frequency by more
xx <- seq(from = 0, to = 8*pi, by = 0.1);
yy <- sin(6*xx^(3/10));
plot(xx, yy, type = "l");

# change the y values to positive, and the x values 1:50
xx <- seq(from = 0, to = 50, length.out=50)
yy <- 500*sin(6*xx^(3/10))+1000
plot(xx, yy, type = "l")


# this was the final sine wave, but I have made the funding peaks every 5 years, resulting in a total of 10 peaks
q <- seq(0,60,length.out=50)
r <- 500*sin(1*q+0)+1000
plot(q,r,type="l", ylim = c(0,1600))

# now I want to try and create a wave with varying wavelength that also has 10 peaks. Althoug this doesnt work - I cant have the same number of peaks and varying wavelengths. The thing that has to be the same is the AUC
xx <- seq(from = 0, to = 60, length.out=50)
yy <- 500*sin(10*xx^(3/10))+1000
plot(xx, yy, type = "l")

xx <- seq(from = 0, to = 60, length.out=50)
